Plan Chad is my (Max Rubel's) front-end capstone project for Nashvile Software School's web developement course.

The app intends to provide a simple, customizable user-interface for planning projects.

The main project page allows users to create, edit, and delete project "segments" and then assign tasks to each segment.  Each segment and task can be scheduled, and the schedule data will appear on the calendar page.  Also each task has a separate field for all your planing information, and another field to view which collaborator is assigned to the task.  Tasks and Segments can each be dragged and dropped around the screen, and there are several customizable view options: "Minimize all," "Hide Completed Tasks," and "Show Progress" (which will print a progress bar on the segment based on how many tasks are completed within.)

The team page allows users to create contacts and then assign them to their own projects as well as tasks. They can also invite contacts to view their project and can see when a contact has visited the page on the "View Invites" portion of the "Teams" page.

The chat function works in real time, so collaborators can all chat about the project in one place.

The tech-stack involved in this app includes:

Next 12/React 18
Framer-Motion Reorder for drag and drop
Firebase for the backend as well as firebase listener functions for the chat
Zustand to manage the state globally of each project

Thank you!
